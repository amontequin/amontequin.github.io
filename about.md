			<h1>About Me</h1>
		</header>
<p>I am a Chicago-based science journalist and researcher in the life sciences. As of Summer 2025, I am in the final stages of finishing a PhD in Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences at Northwestern University and preparing to transition away from the bench and into a writing career. I was a <a href="https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-fellowship/andrew-montequin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025 AAAS Mass Media Fellow</a> with a placement at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. During graduate school I took courses in science journalism and served as a Science Communication Intern for the <a href="https://www.sdbonline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Society for Developmental Biology</a>.</p>
