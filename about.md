			<h1>About Me</h1>
		</header>
<p>I am a Chicago-based science writer and researcher in the life sciences. As of Spring 2025, I am in the final stages of finishing a PhD in Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences at Northwestern University and preparing to transition away from the bench and into a writing career. During graduate school I have taken courses in science journalism, written highlights of pre-printed research as a <a href="https://prelights.biologists.com/profiles/andrewmontequin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PreLighter</a> for The Company of Biologists and served as a Science Communication Intern for the <a href="https://www.sdbonline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Society for Developmental Biology</a>.</p>
